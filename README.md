CNN with Keras on CIFAR-10 using Data Augmentation.

This is my attempt to train a modified version of vggnet of the CIFAR-10 dataset.Initially, the model was overfitting
and the test accuracy was very low, but by adding data augmentation, I was able to achieve over 90 % accuracy.
This is a part of a coursera guided project.
