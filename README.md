CNN with Keras on CIFAR-10 using Data Augmentation.

This is my attempt to train a modified version of vggnet(VGG-16) of the CIFAR-10 dataset.Initially, the model was overfitting
and the test accuracy was very low, but by adding data augmentation and dropout regularization, I was able to achieve an accuracy over 90%.
This is a part of a Coursera guided project.
